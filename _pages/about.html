    <p>Spendlove. Yup. <span style="font-family: 'Source Sans Pro';">/spend/ - /l…ôv/</span> It sounds just like it's spelled. One can imagine the jokes. And I surrounded myself with friends who thought the jokes were much more humorous when we were teenagers than when we were adolescents.</p>
    <p>I'm a husband, father, author, and coder. During the daytime I write mind-numbingly large enterprise applications to put steak on the table. When the sun sets I don my tights and cape and work on smaller, personal projects...the culmination of which have recently added a salt and pepper shaker to the table.</p>
    <p><em>I don't <span style="text-decoration: line-through">really</span> <strong>usually</strong> code in tights or a cape</em>.</p>
    <p>I first knew I was destined to write code when I shipped my first Macintosh application in the 90's. I was irritated by dying continually in Descent. So, I wrote Descent Saved Game Editor. DSGE followed the UNIX tradition: do one task and do it well...allow the user to hack their saved games with vastly superior armor, weaponry, and ungodly quantities of ammunition.</p>
