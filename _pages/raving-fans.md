Over the course of a few decades, one ends up interacting with quite a number of people. I've
collected the thoughts of some of those individuals here.

> Well-spoken, passionate, great personality, and an expert of his craft. I have had the pleasure of working with Curtis and I would highly recommend him. He is very humble and truly has a well thought out plan of his goals and interests in relation to his career and his family. He is extremely loyal and is the type of developer that embraces new challenges, does not cut corners, and will meet and/or exceed all expectations put in front of him. Curtis is an expert coder who can also lead and mentor. He is definitely someone you want on your team.

> I have known Curtis for over 35 years and I have worked with him in various workplaces and on private projects for the past 20 years. I have come to know him as not just an amazing friend but also a very valuable asset to any technical project. True professional experience plus pure passion for code and technology set Curtis apart from most developers. I have never introduced a new technology that he didnâ€™t already know about, and that makes me feel secure when approaching him professionally for service or advice.

> I have known Curtis for many years. He is loyal, friendly and very smart. He has always loved computers and has worked hard to become a great developer. I respected his abilities so much that I recommended him for a position working with me a few years ago. He was a great addition to our team. He worked well on his own and with others, leading younger developers and collaborating with more experienced ones. Curtis is a great coworker, a valuable employee and a very capable leader.

> I worked with Curt for 5 years with him as my dev lead. He's a great co-worker and a great leader. He's very talented as a coder and is excellent at finding solutions to technical problems. As a lead, I never felt that he was overbearing or demanding and I always felt like he was willing to get into the code to help me learn and solve problems. I would absolutely recommend Curt for any software project that needs an experienced and smart leader.
